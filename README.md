molokai fixes issue with parenthesis matching

robbyrussell is my customization to the default oh-my-zsh theme

To install:
- Install nix home manager
- symlink ~/.config/home-manager/home.nix to the relevant nix file in here
- Add nixpkgs-unstable as a channel:
```
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs-unstable
nix-channel --update
```
- home-manager switch
- On Mac: edit /etc/shells to add the nix bash shell at ~/.nix-profile/bin/bash as one of the allowable ones and then run chsh -s ~/.nix-profile/bin.bash
- For some reason I had to manually install vimplug and then run :PlugInstall to get vim to work
- cp .profile into ~. I choose to do this step manually since other programs might alter .profile so I don't want to make it read only.
